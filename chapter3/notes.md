### Chapter III

- Bits and byte

  Bits = 0 | 1
  Byte = 8 bits

  A byte has 3 identities: 
  - it is a string of 8 logical true/false values
  - it is an 8-bit binary number and hence an integer between 0 and 255
  - it is a representation of some character, such as a letter, digit, punctuation mark, or part of
  logogram.
