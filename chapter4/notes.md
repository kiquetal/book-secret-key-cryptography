### Chapter IV

- Cryptographer's toolbox.

      The rating system used for ciphers
      Subsitution ciphers
      Transposition ciphers
      Fractionantion, breaking letters into smaller units
      Pseudoranmdom number generators

- Substitution

      One unit is substituted for another unit in a text.
      Is the Caesar Cipher. Rated one.

- Transposition

      Changing the order of the characters in a text.

- Fractionation

      Fractionation is the division of characters into smaller units. We have already seen
      one way, representing a character as a binary number. Each bit of that binary number
      can be manipulated as a separate unit, substituted or transported.
